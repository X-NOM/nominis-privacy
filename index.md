This page explains how data is handled when using Nominis-operated Custom GPTs available via the public GPT Store. It outlines what information is processed, how it is used, and what is not collected or retained.

Nominis is committed to minimizing data usage, avoiding unnecessary retention, and maintaining transparency aligned with global privacy best practices.

## Data Controller

**Entity:** Nominis.io  
**Role:** Data Controller  
**Jurisdiction:** Global / Neutral

## General Principles (Applies to All Nominis GPTs)

Across all Custom GPTs operated by Nominis, we maintain strict data minimization principles:

- **No user accounts** - Stateless interactions; no profiles or sessions
- **No personal identifiers** - We do not collect names, emails, usernames, or IP addresses
- **No file uploads** - Files, images, screenshots, and documents are not accepted
- **No data monetization** - Data is never sold, shared with third parties, or used for advertising
- **Read-only operations** - All systems operate in read-only mode with no data modification
- **Minimal logging** - Only operational logs for reliability and security are retained (30 days maximum)
- **No behavioral tracking** - Usage patterns and activity are not profiled across sessions

These GPTs serve exclusively as interfaces to structured blockchain analytics and compliance workflows.

# Section 1 — AskYT GPT (Bitcoin Analytics)

## Purpose

**AskYT** is a Bitcoin-only, read-only analytics GPT designed to answer natural-language questions about Bitcoin on-chain activity using Nominis’ internal datasets.

It enables users to explore transaction behavior, address activity, and historical patterns without modifying or enriching the underlying data.

---

## Data Processed

AskYT may process:

- Bitcoin addresses  
- Transaction hashes  
- Time ranges or analytical queries related to Bitcoin activity  

The system produces aggregated or derived blockchain analytics based on the requested query.

AskYT does **not** accept or process:
- Files or documents  
- Images or screenshots  
- Off-chain personal data  

---

## Data Storage & Retention

- Requests are logged solely for operational reliability, debugging, and misuse detection  
- Logs contain limited query metadata and execution status  
- Logs are retained for **up to 30 days**, then deleted  

AskYT does **not** store:
- Query results  
- Historical user profiles  
- Persistent user identifiers  

---

## What AskYT Does Not Do

- No identity attribution or deanonymization  
- No wallet ownership claims  
- No off-chain data enrichment  
- No transaction creation, signing, or broadcasting  

All outputs are informational and analytical in nature.

---

## Intended Audience

AskYT is publicly available and intended for:
- Researchers  
- Analysts  
- Developers  
- Compliance professionals  
- General users exploring Bitcoin activity  

---

# Section 2 — Sanctions Screening GPT

## Purpose

The Sanctions Screening GPT provides sanctions-related checks for blockchain addresses to support compliance and risk assessment workflows.

---

## Data Processed

- Blockchain address(es) submitted by the user  
- Sanctions screening results derived from compliance datasets  

Blockchain addresses are treated as technical identifiers rather than personal data.

---

## Data Storage & Retention

- Requests are logged for operational monitoring and abuse prevention  
- Screening results are not permanently stored  
- Logs are retained for **up to 30 days**, then deleted  

---

## What Is Not Collected

- No personal information  
- No IP address profiling  
- No behavioral or usage profiling  
- No user tracking across sessions  

---

## Intended Use

This GPT is intended for informational and compliance-support purposes only. Results should not be interpreted as legal determinations or enforcement actions.

---

## Security & Access Controls

- Backend systems are access-restricted  
- APIs are read-only and rate-limited  
- Internal datasets are not directly exposed to users  
- Logs are access-controlled and periodically purged  

---

## User Responsibilities
- Use the tools for lawful purposes only
- Avoid submitting sensitive, personal, or confidential data
- Treat outputs as analytical insights, not legal advice or guarantees
- Not attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or misuse the service

---

## Your Privacy Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
- **Access** - Request information about what data we hold
- **Deletion** - Request erasure of your data (within retention windows)
- **Portability** - Receive your data in a portable format
- **Object** - Opt-out of certain processing activities

Requests should be directed to [support@nominis.io](mailto:support@nominis.io) with "Privacy Request" in the subject line. We will respond within 30 days.
